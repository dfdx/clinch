Clinch
======

Clinch is a Clojure library for semantic classification and clusterization of text by using Random Indexing techinque. Random Indexing is a technique similar to well-known [LSA/LSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing), but in constrast to them it is incremental and extremely efficient with a large amounts of data. See [this](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.96.2230&rep=rep1&type=pdf) paper for details.
